Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment and answer the prompts.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Include a brief description of how you tested your programs.

   For this project I collaborated with Lily Garner.

   To test Phase 1, I ran the server and made that it sent a “Ready to serve…” message before opening Safari and connecting to the web server.
 
   To test Phase 2, I put print statements to confirm when the server receives a new request/when the connection closes. I then opened two browsers and observed these print statements to see if the connections would be accepted and end at the same time; tto test whether the server could handle multiple HTTP requests at once. I found this hard because I had to open the second browser very quickly (before the first browser finished connecting).

   To test Phase 3, I accessed client.py through my terminal and used the command format given in the README.md.

   Getting the client to run from the terminal was probably the most challenging part but it was helpful knowing how to use the terminal from our previous homework. It was very satisfying when I got the client to connect. I wanted to add a picture of Saul Goodman but I could not get the HTML to show the image for some reason. I'll include the picture because it's still funny. In the future, I recommend students to do this in its intended sections as I believe this work is easier in bits than trying to fix the whole at one time like I did.
